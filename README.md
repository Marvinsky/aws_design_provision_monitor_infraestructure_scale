Project 2 in the Udacity AWS Cloud Architect nanodegree

Plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. Practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. Use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

Project files from [here](https://github.com/Marvinsky/aws_design_provision_monitor_infraestructure_scale).


<h3>Before you get started</h3>

*   [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/es/cli/).

*   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).


You will also need user accounts for AWS and Terraform.

<h3>Permissions</h3>
The task carried out for this project should be carried out by a user logged in with the IAM role of Administrator with access to Billing information. You can learn more about setting up a user with the Admin role here:
